Food & Nutrient Analysis of Underground Vegetables ðŸ¥•ðŸ¥”




Project Overview

This project analyzes the nutrient composition of underground vegetables (e.g., potatoes, carrots, radishes) and studies how nutrient content changes during harvesting and after different cooking methods (boiling, frying, steaming).

It combines data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning to provide insights into nutrient retention and make dietary recommendations.



Research Objectives

Quantify changes in carbohydrates, proteins, fats, Vitamin C, and minerals.

Compare nutrient retention across cooking methods.

Identify patterns using statistical analysis and machine learning.

Predict nutrient loss for new vegetables or cooking methods.



Methodology / Workflow
Data Collection

Gather raw nutrient data at different stages: harvesting, boiling, frying, steaming.

Sources: lab analysis, spectroscopy, or scientific datasets.

Data Preprocessing

Clean inconsistencies, handle missing values, remove outliers.

Transform data into structured format for analysis.

Normalize nutrient values for comparison across vegetables and cooking methods.

Statistical Analysis

Perform ANOVA, t-tests, or regression to find significant changes in nutrients.

Visualize patterns via graphs and charts for nutrient retention across methods.

Machine Learning

Train models to predict nutrient retention/loss based on vegetable type and cooking method.



Techniques:

Classification: Predict high, medium, or low nutrient loss.

Clustering: Group vegetables with similar nutrient change patterns (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN).

Users can input a vegetable and cooking method to predict expected nutrient retention.

Output

Nutrient retention predictions.

Actionable insights for consumers, dietitians, and researchers.



Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and reporting



Usage

Applications

Determine which cooking methods best preserve nutrients.

Help dietitians design nutritionally optimized meals.

Provide data-driven recommendations for healthy cooking practices.
